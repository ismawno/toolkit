/**
 * @brief A fast general purpose allocator consisting of multiple tiers that allow for different, fixed allocation
 * sizes.
 *
 * Each tier is a memory region with a different size. All tiers combined form the single underlying general buffer this
 * allocator owns. Every tier has an associated, fixed allocation size, such that every tier supports a specific number
 * of available slots of that size. The tier size is always a perfect fit for the allocation size (slot size). The
 * amount of slots each tier holds is not defined directly.
 *
 * Tiers are built from biggest to smallest allocation sizes, and so they are sorted in that manner -> lower tier
 * indices reference bigger allocation size tiers. Note that a low index total tier size may be smaller than a high
 * index total tier size.

     * @brief Create a tier allocator description.
     *
     * The choice of description parameters heavily influences the layout of the tiers and how many allocations each
     * tier supports. The default parameters are suited to create an allocator that supports allocations of up to 1 mb
     * with a reasonable total buffer size. Check the description values to make sure the buffer size has a value that
     * works for you.
     *
     * All integer parameters must be powers of 2. The maximum alignment is provided at construction. Every allocation
     * is guaranteed to be aligned to the maximum alignment or its natural alignment, so the allocator will respect
     * alignment requirements (including the ones set by `alignas`) up to the specified maximum alignment.
     *
     * @param p_MaxAllocation The maximum allocation size the allocator will support. This also equals to the size of
     * the first tier (which is the one with the largest allocation size), meaning only one allocation of
     * `p_MaxAllocation` bytes can be made.
     *
     * @param p_MinAllocation The minimum allowed allocation. Allocation requests smaller than this size will round up
     * to `p_MinAllocation`. It can never be smaller than `sizeof(void *)`.
     *
     * @param p_Granularity It controls how the size difference between tiers evolves, such that the difference between
     * the allocation sizes of tiers i and i + 1 is the next power of 2 from the allocation size i divided by the
     * granularity. A small granularity causes tier sizes to shrink (remember, tiers are built from biggest to smallest)
     * fast in between tiers, reaching `p_MinAllocation` from `p_MaxAllocation` quicker and thus resulting in a smaller
     * total buffer size, but fragmentation risk is higher. Bigger granularities prevent fragmentation but cause the
     * total buffer size to explode very fast. A granularity of 2 for instance means that tiers always double their
     * capacity with respect the previous one. It cannot be greater than `p_MinAllocation`.
     *
     * @param p_TierSlotDecay A value between 0 and 1 that controls how the amount of slots scales when creating tiers
     * with smaller allocation sizes. A tier with index i + 1 will have at least the amount of slots tier i has divided
     * by this value. The tier with index 0 has always exactly one slot. Setting this value too low may cause the buffer
     * size to explode.
