/**
 * @brief A simple task interface that allows the user to create tasks that can be executed by any task manager that
 * inherits from `ITaskManager`.
 *
 * The task is a simple callable object that takes a thread index as an argument. To dynamically allocate tasks, you may
 * use the `Create()`/`Destroy()` methods, which will delegate allocation to a specific per-thread allocator. If using
 * this allocation strategy, tasks must be destroyed by the exact same thread that created them. Otherwise, you may
 * allocate tasks on the stack or with the `new` and `delete` operators.
 *
 * @note A task may only be submitted again if it has finished execution and its `Reset()` method has been called.
 * Multiple threads can wait for the same task at the same time as long as none of them resets it immediately after.
 * Doing so may cause other threads to wait until the task is submitted and finished again, which may never happen or
 * may be a nasty bug to track down.
