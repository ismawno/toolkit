/**
 * @brief A thread pool that manages tasks and executes them in parallel.
 *
 * It is an implementation of the `ITaskManager` interface.
 *
 * Multiple instances of this thread pool should be possible, but it is not tested. In case many instances exist, it is
 * important that threads do not interact with thread pools they dont belong to.
 *
 * All threads this pool uses will be secondary worker threads. By default, the main thread plays no part in
 * the task execution. Please, bear in mind that the thread index is 1-based, as it treats 0 as the main thread in case
 * you want to partition your tasks in such a way that the main thread does some work. If you do not, simply subtract 1
 * when using the thread index.
